        <h2>About</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mahatma Gandhi, also known as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was an influential political and spiritual leader in India who played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British rule.</li>
            <li>He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India. Gandhi is often referred to as the "Father of the Nation" in India and is widely respected for his principles of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience.</li>

    <div class="para">
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gandhi was raised in a devout Hindu family and received his early education in India.</li>
            <li>He later traveled to London to study law and lived in South Africa for about 20 years,</li>
            <li>where he developed his ideas on nonviolent resistance while fighting against racial discrimination faced by Indians in the country.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Championing Nonviolent Resistance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>After returning to India in 1915, Gandhi became the leader of the Indian National Congress, the country's major political party at the time.</li>
            <li>He advocated for the rights of Indians, particularly the poor and marginalized, and started employing nonviolent protest methods to challenge British colonial rule.</li>
            <li>His philosophy of "Satyagraha," meaning "truth force" or "soul force," promoted passive resistance, civil disobedience, and noncooperation as powerful tools to combat oppression and injustice.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
        <h2>Campaign for Indian Independence</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gandhi led several successful civil disobedience campaigns against British policies, such as the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922) and the Salt March (1930).</li>
            <li>The latter involved a 240-mile march to the Arabian Sea, where he and his followers protested against the British salt tax by making salt from seawater.</li>
            <li>These acts of nonviolent resistance gained widespread attention and galvanized the Indian population in their struggle for independence.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
        <h2>Partition of India and Independence</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>India finally gained independence from British rule on August 15, 1947.</li>
            <li>However, the nation was also partitioned into India and Pakistan.</li>
            <li>The communal violence that accompanied the partition deeply troubled Gandhi, who staunchly opposed the division of the country based on religious lines.</li>
            <li>He sought to promote religious harmony and worked to heal the wounds caused by the partition.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>His teachings and methods of nonviolent resistance have inspired numerous civil rights movements.</li>
